Block KVO
=========

Key-Value observing made easier with blocks.
This set of classes use the Objective-C KVO mechanism and allows you to use blocks as observation handlers.
Block KVO can be used and mixed with classic KVO without any problems.

**Requirements:**
  - **iOS 4 and greater**
  - using source files: **ARC enabled**
  - using library: **`-ObjC` and `-all_load` as _Other Linker Flags_ in Build Settings** â€“ this is needed since it adds category to `NSObject`

**Example of typical usage**
  - In `init...` method:

        [self observe:@"window.rootViewController.title"
            withBlock:^(NSString *oldRootTitle, NSString *newRootTitle) {
            NSLog(@"Root view controller's title changed from '%@' to '%@'.", oldRootTitle, newRootTitle);
        }];

  - In `dealloc` method:

        [self removeAllBlockObservers];

Other methods in [`NSObject+MTKBlockObserving.h`](/blob/master/BlockObserving/NSObject%2BMTKBlockObserving.h) are for more advanced use, for example for observing collections/relationships or removing single block observers.

**TODO:** Add documentation comments.
